Intent Radio
============

What?
----

*Intent Radio* is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
interface.  It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of
[broadcast intents](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html).
If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably not the
app for you.

*Intent Radio* was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and
events triggered from [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/).

Despite the name, *Intent Radio* will happily play local audio media too.

Where?

More information, downloads and a sample Tasker project are available on
the project [home page](http://intent-radio.smblott.org/).
