Intent Radio
============

Who?
----

You might be interested in *Intent Radio* if:

- you use Android,
- you use [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/), and
- you listen to internet radio.

What?
----

*Intent Radio* is an android internet radio app without a graphical user
interface.  It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of
[broadcast intents](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html).
If you do not know what a broadcast intent is, then this is probably not the
app for you.

*Intent Radio* was written primarily to be driven by shortcuts, tasks and
events triggered from [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/).

Where?
------

More information -- including details of broadcast intents -- and a sample [Tasker project](http://smblott.org/intent_radio/Radio.prj.xml) are
available on the project [home page](http://smblott.org/intent_radio/).
