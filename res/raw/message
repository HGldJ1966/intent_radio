<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
   Intent Radio is a streaming internet radio app without a graphical user
   interface.  It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast
   intents.  Automation apps, such as Tasker, should be used to control streaming
   playback by issuing suitable broadcast intents.
</p>

<p>
   This app must be run once before Android will deliver intents to its background
   service. This is an Android security feature.
</p>

<p>
   Thereafter, including after reboots, it should not be necessary the run this
   app at all.
</p>

<h3>Media Player</h3>

<p>
   All aspects of media playback are handled by the built-in Android media player.
   Additionally, playlist URLs (whose URL/name must end with ".pls") are also
   supported.
</p>

<p>
   During playback, Intent Radio adds a notification to the notification area.
   Clicking on this notification stops playback.
</p>

<p>
   Some URLs, notably the default BBC Radio 4 stream, take in excess of 30 seconds
   for playback to start.  Sorry, but I don't know why!  Please be patient.
