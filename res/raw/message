Intent Radio is a streaming internet radio app without a graphical user interface.  It is controlled exclusively through the delivery of broadcast intents.  Automation apps, such as Tasker, should be used to control streaming playback by issuing suitable broadcast intents.

This app must be run once before Android will deliver intents to its background service. This is an Android security feature.

Thereafter, including after reboots, it should not be necessary the run this app at all.

During playback, Intent Radio adds a notification to the notification area.  Clicking on this notification stops playback.

Broadcast intents:

   org.zapto.smblott.intentradio.PLAY
   extras:
      url:URL (optional, default is BBC Radio 4)
      name:NAME (optional, default is URL)

   org.zapto.smblott.intentradio.STOP
   (no extras)

All extras are strings.  Use the buttons below to copy these intents to the clipboard.

All aspects of media playback are handled by the built-in Android media player.  Additionally, playlist URLs (whose URL/name must end with ".pls") are also supported.

Some URLs, notably the default BBC Radio 4 stream, take in excess of 30 seconds for playback to start.  Sorry, but I don't know why!  Please be patient.

Some logging/debugging information is written to:

   /sdcard/Android/data/...
      .../org.zapto.smblott.intentradio/...
         .../files/intent-radio.log
